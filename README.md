# Game-Development-Zombie-Bird-

The project is the collaboration of four team members to design the game similar to the Flappy Bird with our 
own adventurous still. Flappy bird is a mobile game in which a player controls a birdâ€™s flight height to avoid obstacles. 
Pressing on the screen for a longer period of time allows the bird to fly higher, while letting go causes the bird to fly lower.

Box2D physics in a game.
